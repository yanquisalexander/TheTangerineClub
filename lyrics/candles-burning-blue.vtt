00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.878
All is fading brighter

00:00:17.878 --> 00:00:23.116
So why we feel the same?

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:25.979
Shadows lifting all around

00:00:25.979 --> 00:00:30.922
And no memories to frame

00:00:30.922 --> 00:00:34.136
Our dreams are just like paper birds

00:00:34.136 --> 00:00:38.955
Lost in winds of time

00:00:38.955 --> 00:00:41.603
Our love is like a stranger

00:00:41.603 --> 00:00:47.049
And the people passing by

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:49.950
They say Love is a riddle

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.975
Love's a sacred law

00:00:54.975 --> 00:00:57.874
It lifts us to the heavens

00:00:57.874 --> 00:01:03.062
Then watches as we fall

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:05.916
They say Love is a riddle

00:01:05.916 --> 00:01:10.781
Love's a sacred law

00:01:10.781 --> 00:01:13.761
It lifts us to the heavens

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:25.122
Then watches as we fall

00:01:25.122 --> 00:01:27.909
Living in the silence

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.945
Of candles burning blue

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:35.896
Up above the towers

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:41.098
There ain't no solitude

00:01:41.098 --> 00:01:44.127
Memories are made of stone

00:01:44.127 --> 00:01:49.032
A taste of bitter truth

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:51.608
It's like we never knew love

00:01:51.608 --> 00:01:56.989
We were searching for our youth

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:00.002
They say Love is a riddle

00:02:00.002 --> 00:02:04.989
Love's a sacred law

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:07.746
It lifts us to the heavens

00:02:07.746 --> 00:02:13.062
Then watches as we fall

00:02:13.062 --> 00:02:15.968
They say Love is a riddle

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:21.010
Love's a sacred law

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.809
It lifts us to the heavens

00:02:23.809 --> 00:02:29.633
Then watches as we fall

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:31.949
As we fall

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:37.203
Then watches as we fall

00:02:37.203 --> 00:03:15.317
As we fall

00:03:15.317 --> 00:03:17.890
They say Love is a riddle

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.174
Love's a sacred law

00:03:23.174 --> 00:03:25.681
It lifts us to the heavens

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:31.263
Then watch us as we fall

00:03:31.263 --> 00:03:33.918
They say Love is a riddle

00:03:33.918 --> 00:03:38.738
Love's a sacred law

00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:41.789
It lifts us to the heavens

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:42.789
Then watch us as we fall
