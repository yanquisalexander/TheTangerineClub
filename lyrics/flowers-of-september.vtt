00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
The flowers of September

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500
Days that I remember or just try

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.500
To represent it tenderly

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
Shame on you, surrender

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.500
To the system like I do

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.500
Cowardly

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.500
And through the alleyways

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.500
We lost control

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Dreaming of the ocean

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
Hey, what's going on?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.505
It's not so hard thinking of a way

00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:06.501
To become

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:16.501
Ah, anywhere so far

00:01:17.001 --> 00:01:22.549
Is it hard to see?

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.512
Don't know where we are

00:01:27.012 --> 00:01:43.542
And what we may find

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:46.516
The flowers of September

00:01:47.016 --> 00:01:49.555
Blooming on a desert of my mind

00:01:50.055 --> 00:01:55.572
Is there a place where we can breathe?

00:01:56.072 --> 00:01:58.819
I see you by the pathway

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.900
Golden lips and fire heart

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.119
Charmingly

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.293
And through the alleyways

00:02:11.793 --> 00:02:14.121
We lost control

00:02:14.621 --> 00:02:20.216
Dreaming of the ocean

00:02:20.716 --> 00:02:30.091
Ah, anywhere so far

00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:36.462
Is it hard to see?

00:02:36.962 --> 00:02:40.095
Don't know where we are

00:02:40.595 --> 00:02:46.229
And what we may find here

00:02:46.729 --> 00:03:00.946
Or what we may try so hard to see
